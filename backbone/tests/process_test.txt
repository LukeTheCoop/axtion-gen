Payne, then a Sergeant First Class in the U.S. Army’s elite Delta Force, participated in a high-stakes hostage rescue mission in Hawija, Iraq. Intelligence had revealed that 70 hostages were facing imminent execution by ISIS militants. Under the cover of darkness, Payne and his team were inserted by helicopter near the prison compound. They swiftly engaged the enemy, breaching a building to liberate 37 hostages. Amidst intense gunfire and with the building engulfed in flames, Payne learned of additional hostages trapped in a second building. Without regard for his own safety, he fought his way inside, cutting through locks to free the remaining captives. Despite the collapsing structure and relentless enemy fire, Payne’s unwavering determination ensured the successful rescue of all 70 hostages. For his extraordinary heroism, he was awarded the Medal of Honor on September 11, 2020.",
