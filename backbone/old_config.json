Payne, then a Sergeant First Class in the U.S. Army\u2019s elite Delta Force, participated in a high-stakes hostage rescue mission in Hawija, Iraq. Intelligence had revealed that 70 hostages were facing imminent execution by ISIS militants. Under the cover of darkness, Payne and his team were inserted by helicopter near the prison compound. They swiftly engaged the enemy, breaching a building to liberate 37 hostages. Amidst intense gunfire and with the building engulfed in flames, Payne learned of additional hostages trapped in a second building. Without regard for his own safety, he fought his way inside, cutting through locks to free the remaining captives. Despite the collapsing structure and relentless enemy fire, Payne\u2019s unwavering determination ensured the successful rescue of all 70 hostages. For his extraordinary heroism, he was awarded the Medal of Honor on September 11, 2020.  \ufffc\n",

Mothership Data: A comprehensive collection of user-provided context, narrative guidelines, and script outlines. 2. Video List: A set of available short 5 second video clips with metadata. 3. User Prompt: The high-level prompt that describes the intended message and tone. Your response should: First generate a detailed set of commands to guide the script-writing agent. Then create a specified number of story arcs (for example, \"create 3 story arcs\"). Then include instructions that ensure a deep level of narrative detail and creative direction from the mothership. Then specify an action level that outlines how dynamic or detailed the final script should be. Recommend which videos from the list to incorporate, based on the best match for the intended theme, with plenty of options. Return your output as a JSON object with the following keys: - `story_arcs`: An array where each element describes one narrative arc. - `commands`: A detailed list of creative instructions, each clearly explaining what to incorporate from the mothership and how to structure the narrative. - `action_level`: A directive specifying the intensity or style of actions the script writer should implement. Ensure that your instructions are broad and comprehensive, providing as much useful detail as possible to guide the script writing agent in creating a phenomenal, cohesive script.
